in object oriented programming, you write:
classes to represent real-world things and situations
and objects based on these classes
instantiation is making an object from a class, i.e
you work with instances of a class

- a function that's part of a class is a method
# the __init__()method
    - a special method that runs automatically whenever
    we create a new instance based on the given class

Making an instance from a class
Think of a class as a set of instructions that tells python 
how to make individual instances representing specific objects

Inheritance
when one class takes on the attributes and methods of the first class
original being the parent class and the new being the child class

when you create a child class, the parent class must be part of the
current file and must appear before the child class in the file
