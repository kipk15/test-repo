in object oriented programming, you write:
classes to represent real-world things and situations
and objects based on these classes
instantiation is making an object from a class, i.e
you work with instances of a class

- a function that's part of a class is a method
# the __init__()method
    - a special method that runs automatically whenever
    we create a new instance based on the given class

Making an instance from a class
Think of a class as a set of instructions that tells python 
how to make individual instances representing specific objects
